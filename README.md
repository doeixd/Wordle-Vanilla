# Wordle - Vanilla
**A [Wordle](http://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle) clone made using vanilla JavaScript**

## Purpose
I created this as an educational exercise, and as a project to add to my portfolio.

## Features
This wordle clone does not attempt to be a 100% accurate clone, but here are features currently supported

- [x] Basic Gameplay

- [x] Shareable Game Representation

## Roadmap
I intend for Wordle - Vanilla to become more fully featured than the original. Here are some currently planned features.

- [ ] Instructions Modal
- [ ] Full A11y
- [ ] One-Per-Day/Hourly Mode with Timer
- [ ] Options Center
- [ ] Color Blind Mode
- [ ] Wordle Definition
- [ ] Progressive Web App Support

- [ ] More Interesting Stats e.g. Colored Stats/Animated Graph
- [ ] User Generated Games/Shareable Games

- [ ] Variable Wordle Lengths
- [ ] User Accounts


## Note On Rules
1. A particular letter (e.g. 'N') will only 'light up' (be colored green or yellow) as many times as it is in the word.
2. If you repeat a letter more times than it is contained in the word, and one of the repeated letters is in the correct position, that letter will always light up in green.
3. If you repeat a letter more times than it is contained in the word, but none of the repeated letters is in the correct position, the first letter will light up in yellow.
