## Note On Rules
1. A particular letter (e.g. 'N') will only 'light up' (be colored green or yellow) as many times as it is in the word.
2. If you repeat a letter more times than it is contained in the word, and one of the repeated letters is in the correct position, that letter will always light up in green.
3. If you repeat a letter more times than it is contained in the word, but none of the repeated letters is in the correct position, the first letter will light up in yellow.
